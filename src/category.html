                    <p>
                        <a href="detail.html">A Kind of Magic</a> was Queen's first album to be released since
                        they had received acclaim for their
                        performance at Live Aid in 1985. It was an immediate hit in the UK, going straight to number one
                        and selling 100,000 copies in its first week.
                    </p>
                    <p>Although Queen would release another two albums with Freddie Mercury still alive, A Kind of Magic
                        would turn out to be his last album promoted with a concert tour, due to his diagnosis with AIDS
                        the following year.</p>

                        <a href="#"></a>A Night at the Opera is the fourth studio album by the British rock band Queen,
                        released on 21

                        Produced by Roy Thomas Baker and Queen, it was reportedly the most expensive album ever recorded
                        at the time of its release.

                    <p>
                        <a href="#">A Day at the Races</a> is the fifth studio album by the British rock band Queen,
                        released on 10
                        December 1976 by EMI Records in the United Kingdom and by Elektra Records in the United States.
                        Recorded at The Manor, Sarm East, and Wessex Sound Studios in England, it was the band's first
                        completely self-produced album, and the first completed without the involvement of producer Roy
                        Thomas Baker; engineering duties were handled by Mike Stone. It serves as a companion to Queen's
                        previous album, A Night at the Opera, with both taking their names from Marx Brothers films and
                        having similar packaging and eclectic musical themes.

                    <p>
                        <a href="#">Jazz</a> is the seventh studio album by the British rock band Queen. It was released
                        on 10 November
                        1978 by EMI Records in the United Kingdom and by Elektra Records in the United States. Produced
                        by Roy Thomas Baker, the album artwork was suggested by Roger Taylor, who previously saw a
                        similar design painted on the Berlin Wall.[7] The album's varying musical styles were
                        alternately praised and criticised. It reached number two in the UK Albums Chart and number six
                        on the US Billboard Top LPs & Tape chart.

                        <a href="#">The Game</a> is the eighth studio album by the British rock band Queen. It was
                        released on 30 June
                        1980 by EMI Records in the UK and by Elektra Records in the US. The Game features a different
                        sound from its predecessor, Jazz (1978). The Game was the first Queen album to use a
                        synthesizer[5] (an Oberheim OB-X).
