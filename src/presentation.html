                <p class="v-margins h-margins">Queen formed in 1971 and in 1973 signed their first recording contract
                    for
                    EMI. That year they
                    released
                    their first album, Queen. The same year saw their first major UK tour, and in 1974 they released
                    Queen
                    II as well as making their first UK headlining tour. They made their first US tour, and in November
                    released Sheer Heart Attack which was a hit on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
